# gdocwiki

A wiki based on Google Doc / Drive tailored to Aliz needs

## Overview

Gdocwiki combines a folder tree view in a sidebar (equivalent to drive.google.com) with a document viewer in the main panel (equivalent to docs.google.com, etc). Documents can be browsed and edited without opening (lots of) new tabs. This helps the user stay in flow and understand the folder hierarchy.

Gdocwiki also helps with understanding lots of documents. README files in a folder are automatically rendered to give an overview of a directory. Tags and folder hierarchy are shown wherever docs are shown.

Gdocwiki defaults to a mobile-friendly HTML preview with comments. Switch to edit mode to start writing. On mobile this will link out to the Google Docs mobile app.

## Development

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/), [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

2. Install dependencies:

   ```shell
   cd packages/website
   yarn
   ```

3. Create `.env.local` file for configuration. See [Configuration](#configuration) section below.

4. Start a local development server:

   ```shell
   yarn start
   ```

5. Navigate to http://localhost:3000

## Deployment

You should set up a configuration for local development and building by creating a `.env.local` file. This file is not needed for deployment, since it is embedded into the artifact during the building process.

A sample `.env.local` file could be:

```plain
REACT_APP_GAPI_KEY=xxxxxxx
REACT_APP_GAPI_CLIENT_ID=xxxxxxx
```

- `REACT_APP_GAPI_KEY`: The Google API Key.

  Google API Key can be obtained by following the [Setting up API keys](https://support.google.com/googleapi/answer/6158862) documentation.

- `REACT_APP_GAPI_CLIENT_ID`: The Google API OAuth Client ID.

  The OAuth Client ID can be obtained by following the [Setting up OAuth 2.0](https://support.google.com/googleapi/answer/6158849) documentation.

  Steps in the "User consent" section in the documentaton above should be completed as well, with the following scopes added:

  - `auth/drive`
  - `auth/documents`

- `REACT_APP_ROOT_ID`: Optional. The ID of the Google drive folder that you want to display as the wiki root folder.

  ![](etc/root_folder.png)

  There may be hyphens in the ID. The wiki root folder is not limited to a sub-folder in the shared drive. It could be the shared drive root folder.

  **Note**: Only folders in the "[Shared drives](https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/9310351)" are supported. Folders in the "My Drive" are not supported.

- `REACT_APP_ROOT_DRIVE_ID`: Optional. The drive ID where your wiki root folder belongs.
